# A black OS X Leopard Terminal theme that is actually readable

This Terminal theme was created by [Todd Werth](http://toddwerth.com). Read his original blog post [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20110827084827/http://blog.toddwerth.com/entries/show/6). 

This repository contains all the necessary files to get it working under Mac OS 10.7+; conveniently in one place.

# Mac OS 10.7+

The OS X terminal has support for ANSI colors since 10.7+ which negates the use SIMBL/TerminalColours.bundle. Simply install the IR_Black terminal file and set it as default.

Optionally you could add [Todd's bash scripts](http://github.com/twerth/dotfiles).

## Misc

If you're experiencing a font difference when connecting an external monitor try [OS X hints - 10.6: Re-enable LCD font smoothing for some monitors](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20090828224632809&query=mar)

> [...] OS X incorrectly detects many third party LCD monitors as CRTs, and consequently, disables LCD font smoothing.
